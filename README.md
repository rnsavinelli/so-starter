## Intro

This Book is the Property of the ~~Half-Blood~~ Half-Coder Prince.

![Advances OS Making](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/harrypotter/images/b/b9/Advanced_Potion_Making..png/revision/latest?cb=20210822080741)

Inspired by Harry Potter's World, In which [Severus Snape makes importants anotattions]((https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Severus_Snape%27s_copy_of_Advanced_Potion-Making)) for improvements over a study book. I decided to develop my own implementation for the Operating System Course Assignment.

## Getting Started

I will assume you already have a  **GitHub account**, a team with at least **Two and a Half** ~~Men~~ **Programmers**.

### Installation

I highly recommend running your `Ubuntu` or `Mint` native. The server **must** be run on `VBox` or any other virtualization product.

Once on your environment OS, you **must** install the following dependencies:

With `CTRL` + `ALT` + `T` you can open a Terminal.

Paste the following commands:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade -y
sudo apt-get install git build-essential valgrind bison flex
sudo snap install code --classic
```

This will install you the necessary tools to build your project, indluding git, make and valgrind.

Now clear your terminal

```
clear
```

And  Clone the starter repository and install the dependencies (commons and readline). Paste the following commands:

```
mkdir -p Dev
cd Dev
git clone https://github.com/tomasanchez/so-starter.git
cd so-starter
sudo make install
```

With this you are all set.

### Openning the project


```
cd Dev/so-starter
code .
```

This should open `VsCode` in the `so-start` directory.

Run

```
make test
```

If you obtain

```
RESULTS: X tests (X ok, 0 failed, 0 skipped) ran in Y ms
Tests completed.
```

Then everything is working correctly.

I highly recommend configuring format on paste, on save and on type, to maintain a formatted file.

There too many directories! However, it is easy to understand.

1. `.github`: [Workflows](#workflows) actions for Continuous Integration.
2. `.vscode`: [Launching options](#launching-options) and other `Code` configurations.
3. `build`: Executables files will be placed here.
4. `config`: Configuration directory container, all `.cfg` files should be placed in here.
5. `lib`: Shared library module, for sharing functionalities among modules.
6. `shard`: All Shared objects (`*.o` files) are stored here.
7. `client`: a module implementation example  of the TP0 client.
8. `server`: a module implementation example of the TP0 server.


#### Workflows

GitHub Actions jobs can be automatically triggered, where they run, and how they can interact with the code in your repository. This starter has a job for testing the project. Each module will execute defined test.

This workflow will allow you to use Continuous Integration in your project, when `push` or `pull request` on main branch.

If all test passed, you will see a :heavy_check_mark: in the top. Otherwise, a :x: will be displayed. So when pull request are created, your team can easily `approve/reject` the pull request, checking not only merge conflicts but test passed.


#### Makefile

The `Makefile` in the root directory is used to build a project with different modules.

The following commands are available

1. make install
2. make test
3. make YOUR_MODULE_NAME

You should modifythe following rules, and add new ones as explained below:

This starter includes two modules, server and client. Which is a solution for [UTN FRBA OS-Course TP0](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wBsTIlPc_4UKyHRUVxoY3VIepBO_tMq9CNqz3wGoGlA/edit).

This snippet displays the modules directories names.

```shell
# Modules directories - with their own makefile
SERVER_DIR=server
CLIENT_DIR=client
```
Then below:

```shell
.PHONY: server client clean install test install-commons

# Directories list
DIRS = $(SERVER_DIR) $(CLIENT_DIR)

client:
	cd $(CLIENT_DIR) && $(MAKE_COMPILE)

server:
	cd $(SERVER_DIR) && $(MAKE_COMPILE)
```

When creating your own module you **MUST** declare it in this `Makefile`.

suppose, you add a `Memory` module, in a directory `/memory`, then your `Makefile` should look like this

```shell
# Modules directories - with their own makefile
SERVER_DIR=server
CLIENT_DIR=client
MEMORY_DIR=memory
```

```shell
.PHONY: server client memory clean install test install-commons

# Directories list
DIRS = $(SERVER_DIR) $(CLIENT_DIR)

client:
	cd $(CLIENT_DIR) && $(MAKE_COMPILE)

memory:
	cd $(MEMORY_DIR) && $(MAKE_COMPILE)

server:
	cd $(SERVER_DIR) && $(MAKE_COMPILE)
```

The keyword `MEMORY_DIR` has been added with the value of your directory name `memory`.

`.PHONY` has been modified, adding `memory` after `client`.

`memory` rule has been added, just paste any of the client or server rules and change the `$(DIRECTORY)`

**NOTE**: About copying & pasting `Makefile`, make sure to set up a `.editorconfig` in your root folder with the following configuration

```properties
# top-most EditorConfig file
root = true

[*]
indent_style = tab
indent_size = 4
end_of_line = lf
charset = utf-8
trim_trailing_whitespace = true
insert_final_newline = true
```

The important is to set `indent_style` to `tab` otherwise makefile could result in the following error:

```shell
makefile:13: *** missing separator.  Stop.
```

It is recommend to

```shell
cp Makefile DESTINATION_PATH
```

Where `DESTINATION_PATH` is the path where the Makefile will be copied.

#### Creating your Module

You can easily create your module copying an example module, and modifying the root `Makefile` as shown [above](#makefile).

```shell
cp -r client memory
```

**OR** copy the server...

```shell
cp -r server memory
```

Then when inside the `memory` directory, run:

```shell
make run
```

This will `compile` the module creating a `memory.out` executable in `/build`, and execute it. To test your module you should run:

```shell
make test
```

This will run the test defined in `/memory/test`, creating a `memory_out.out` executable.

**NOTE**: the naming of the directory determines the name of the `.out` file.
Eg. `/example` module will create a `/build/example.out.` and a `/build/example_test.out` files.

#### Launching Options

For debugging using `VsCode`, a `launch.json` should be defined inside `.vscode` directory.

This template contains already a `launch.json` file, I recommend coyping the configurations and modifying for corresponding executables.

```json
{
      "name": "Example",
      "type": "cppdbg",
      "request": "launch",
      "program": "${workspaceFolder}/build/example.out",
      "args": [],
      "stopAtEntry": false,
      "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}",
      "environment": [],
      "externalConsole": false,
      "MIMode": "gdb",
      "setupCommands": [
        {
          "description": "Enable pretty-printing for gdb",
          "text": "-enable-pretty-printing",
          "ignoreFailures": true
        }
      ]
},
```

By only modifying `"name": "Your_Module_Name` and `"program":"${workspaceFolder}/build/YOUR_MODULE_NAME.out"`, for debugging test you should add another configuration, changing also `"name"` with `Your_Moodule_Name TEST` and `"program"` with `YOUR_MODULE_NAME_test.out` value.

Eg. of a A full `launch.json` with the `memory` module.

```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "Memory",
      "type": "cppdbg",
      "request": "launch",
      "program": "${workspaceFolder}/build/memory.out",
      "args": [],
      "stopAtEntry": false,
      "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}",
      "environment": [],
      "externalConsole": false,
      "MIMode": "gdb",
      "setupCommands": [
        {
          "description": "Enable pretty-printing for gdb",
          "text": "-enable-pretty-printing",
          "ignoreFailures": true
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "Memory",
      "type": "cppdbg",
      "request": "launch",
      "program": "${workspaceFolder}/build/memory_test.out",
      "args": [],
      "stopAtEntry": false,
      "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}",
      "environment": [],
      "externalConsole": false,
      "MIMode": "gdb",
      "setupCommands": [
        {
          "description": "Enable pretty-printing for gdb",
          "text": "-enable-pretty-printing",
          "ignoreFailures": true
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Going Further

### Versioning

[`standard-version`](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version) is an utility for versioning and [`CHANGELOG.md`](./CHANGELOG.md).


Install `yarn`.

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install yarn
```

If you already don’t have Node.js installed on your system , the command above will install it. Those who are using nvm can skip the Node.js installation with:

```
sudo apt install --no-install-recommends yarn
```

Verfy it with

```
yarn --version
```

#### Project Package

You will see a `package.json` file containing the following:

```json
{
	"name": "so-starter",
	"version": "1.1.0",
	"description": "A description",
	"repository": "https://github.com/tomasanchez/so-starter.git",
 	"author": "Tomas <tosanchez@frba.utn.edu.ar>",
}
```

You should modify the `"name"` to your project name. `"version"` should be "0.0.1", `"repository"` to your project repository. And `"author"` to your contact information.

This allows you the following scripts.

**NOTE**: You should remove the [`CHANGELOG`](./CHANGELOG.md) file before running the `first-release` script.

`yarn release:first-release` Will be your first release and will create a new git tag with the name `v.0.0.1`.

`yarn release:patch`: Will bump your version to `X.Y.+1` - use `patch` when fixing bugs.

`yarn release:minor`: Will bump your version to `X.+1.Z` - use `minor` when adding new features.

`yarn release:major`: Will bump your version to `+1.Y.Z` - use `major` when releasing breaking changes to previous versions.

#### Signature

To make use of this you will have to...

1. Install `gnupg2`:

```
sudo apt install gnupg2
```

2. Configure git to use `gnupg2`

```
git config --global gpg.program gpg2
```

3. Generate a `gpg` key

```
gpg --gen-key
```

#### Commiting

Recommended: read [this article](https://www.mokkapps.de/blog/how-to-automatically-generate-a-helpful-changelog-from-your-git-commit-messages/) about **semantic versions**, _conventional commits_, and using `standard-version`.

So when you run

`yarn release` there will be an automatically-generated changelog with your commit references.

There is also `yarn release:minor`, `yarn release:patch` and `yarn realease:major`. To follow the semantic versioning.
